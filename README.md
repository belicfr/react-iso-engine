# React/PIXI.js isometric engine

_Simple isometric game engine, using React and PIXI.js frameworks. Educational purpose only._

## A Client-side engine

This project consists in creating an isometric game engine, a back-end emulator will be created 
in the future in a different repository.

## Technologies

There are two subprojects:
1. Develop a PIXI.js-based isometric game engine, playable without third-party software.
2. Develop a React client implementing the game engine, with a user-friendly graphic interface.

## Main features (WIP)

- Game engine itself
- Main player GUI
- Moderation tools (MOD tools and users & rooms management systems)
- Furnis management system
- Inventory and marketplace
- Badges system
- Player's avatar imager
- Avatars' effects
- APIs to retrieve users, rooms, etc. information
- Pipelines for generating images from players' creations
- and moreâ€¦

## Assets

To use properly this engine, isometric assets must be used.
The engine uses a tiles-based physics, so the assets 
must be tiles-based using the 1:2 ratio.
